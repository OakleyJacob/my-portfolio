## Introduction

As a dedicated gamer and a React.js enthusiast, I decided to combine my two passions to create this video game-themed portfolio. This project not only serves as a showcase of my web development skills but also reflects my love for video games.

In this portfolio, you will find a selection of my gaming-related projects, including interactive game websites, game reviews, and more. I've also included a brief introduction to myself and my journey as a developer.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: The core framework used to build this portfolio.
- **JavaScript**: For scripting and interactivity.
- **HTML & CSS**: For structuring and styling the content.
- **Rspec**: For testing.

## Projects

Here are some of the featured projects in this portfolio:

1. Tic-Tac-Toe: A simple tic-tac-toe game allowing the user to play with difficulty levels and select their own icon.

2. Keep Wagging: A full stack application built with react and rails with full CRUD functionality.
